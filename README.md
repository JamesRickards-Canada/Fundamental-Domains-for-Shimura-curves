# JamesRickards-Canada-Fundamental-Domains-for-Shimura-curves

This package is a PARI/GP implementation of fundamental domains for Shimura curves. You can compute fundamental domains and view them with a Python application (using Matplotlib).

To use this package with GP, download fdom.gp, fdom.so, and fdviewer.py, and call "gp fdom" from the appropriate folder.
